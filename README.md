# sharpy-sc2

Sharpy is a Python framework for rapid development of Starcraft 2 AI bots.

Sharpy is built on top of [python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2) and it is the framework used by [Sharpened Edge](https://aiarena.net/bots/40/) bot.

Sharpy was created to make it as easy as possible to create practice dummies for testing against Sharpened Edge. Sharpy contains everything needed to run all the practise dummies, as well as means to create more.

Sharpy is a work in progress. The folder structure and classes are subject to change.

### Build statuses

Master branch ![](https://github.com/DrInfy/sharpy-sc2/workflows/Python%20actions/badge.svg?branch=master)

Develop branch ![](https://github.com/DrInfy/sharpy-sc2/workflows/Python%20actions/badge.svg?branch=develop)

### Requirements

1. Python 3.8/3.9/3.11 64-bit
   * Python-sc2 requires python 3.8
   * 64-bit requirement comes from [sc2-pathlib](https://github.com/DrInfy/sc2-pathlib) as the pathlib is built for 64-bit python 3.8/3.9/3.11
1. Windows, Linux or MacOS
   * This requirement comes from [sc2-pathlib](https://github.com/DrInfy/sc2-pathlib)
   * macOS should be supported, but I have no way to test it [sc2-pathlib](https://github.com/DrInfy/sc2-pathlib) is built for it.

### Ladder Dummy Bots

To build dummy bots for ladder, run ladder_zip.py. Bots will appear as individual zip files in publish folder.

### Getting started

Read the [getting started](https://github.com/DrInfy/sharpy-sc2/wiki/Getting-Started) guide in wiki.

## Contributing

To contribute to sharpy-sc2 source code, please create a pull request.

We also appreciate well written issues, comments and improvements to project wiki.

### Pull Request Process

* Keep pull requests small and atomic. Change only one logical thing at a time.
* If you do a pull request for unit micro, showcase it with a dummy bot and explain how it improves the previous implementation
* All Github actions checks for the PR must pass before it will be reviewed.
    * Make sure that the source code is formatted according to rules (see below)
    * Make sure that the source code passes linting
    * Make sure that all tests pass

## Developing sharpy-sc2

### Using Virtual Environment

#### Windows

Virtual Environments (venv) can be used to isolate this project's Python dependencies from other projects.

You can create a virtual environment for this project with

```
venv-create.bat
```

And activate it with

```
venv-activate.bat
```

Venv needs to be activated for every new console window, so it may be helpful to create an alias such as
```
doskey sharpy=cd C:\Dev\sharpy-sc2 $T venv-activate.bat
```

More information about virtual environments can be found from the [documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/venv.html)

#### Other operating systems

You may replicate the commands used by the above bat scripts to work on your own operating system. 

### Installing Depedencies

To install all dependencies required to run the bots, use

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install all development dependencies, use

```
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

#### Pre-commit hooks

To install git pre-commit hooks that will run black and flake8 (see below), use

```
pre-commit install
```

If you ever want to uninstall the hooks, use

```
pre-commit uninstall
```

or simply uninstall the `.git\hooks\pre-commit` file.

### Code Formatting

sharpy-sc2 uses [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) for automatic Python source code formatting.

to format code automatically, run 

```
> py -m black .
All done! ✨ � ✨
272 files left unchanged.
```

Black can also be integrated to your favorite editor. See Editor Integration section in [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/#editor-integration) readme.

### Linting

sharpy-sc2 uses [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) for source code linting.

To run flake8 linting, use

```
> py -m flake8
0
```

### Running Tests

Tests are written using [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html).

To run all tests, use

```
pytest
```

To run tests from a single test file, use `pytest path-to-file` eg.

```
pytest sharpy\knowledges\knowledge_test.py
```

pytest follows standard test discovery rules and will run all tests in the current directory and its subdirectories.

For new tests, make sure that...
1. file name follows the naming pattern of `*_test.py`
1. the test class name starts with `Test*`
1. all test methods start with `test_*`.
